# Imports and Stuff
As of version 60 of Firefox, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import](import) is supported natively in the browsers I care about for debugging - the other ones I can deal with bundling.

The goal of this project is to make a simple Knockout components based app that
uses the import syntax and thus modules natively.
